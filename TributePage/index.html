      At the age of 9, she was raped. Monster that did that, took her to the ice
      cream shop with the blood still running down her legs. At the age of 10,
      she endured molestation by two close family relatives. At 14, she became
      pregnant, a secret she hid until the day of the child's delivery. The baby
      was born premature and later died due to complications. Her mother gave up
      her younger sister for adoption and her brother lost his life to AIDS.
      From that moment on, she dedicated herself to rising above her
      circumstances. She faced another setback after losing her job at 23,
      because her employers thought she got emotionally invested in her stories.
      Taking her loss as a sign, she began her career on television and in 1984
      as a morning show host. Working day and night with persistence and
      consistency. Soon she became the undisputed queen of television talk
      shows, before amassing a media empire. Today she is worth an estimated
      $2.9 billion and she is richest African American and the 32nd most
      philanthropist women in the world. Mainstream media called her the most
      powerful women. Most people would use her early life as an excuse, but she
      was not consumed, she prevailed. In my opinion she is the most courageous
      women alive.
